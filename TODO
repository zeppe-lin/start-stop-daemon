TODO start-stop-daemon

	- [ ] Add --status-message option to display --status return
		codes as text.  This will help to get rid of
		boilerplate in /etc/rc.d/ files and to return the exit
		code in one command.  The last is a good thing for
		automation and scripting purposes.

	- [ ] Backport some improvements from:
		https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc/blob/master/src/start-stop-daemon/start-stop-daemon.c
		https://www.mankier.com/8/start-stop-daemon.openrc

End of file.
